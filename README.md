In this case,the Random Forest algorithm is used,and I omit some variables regarding the basic knowledge.Next,
I calculate the correlations between variables, and omit those high-correlated variables. 
And divide the training set into two parts(60% for training and 40% for validation).
The training seems working well that the validation accuracy is 99.8%.
